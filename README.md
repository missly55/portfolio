**About Me:**

Hi, Iâ€™m Lynell, an aspiring IT Support and Cybersecurity professional whoâ€™s passionate about learning and building real-world experience through hands-on, self-taught projects and labs.

Iâ€™m currently working on developing technical skills through platforms like TryHackMe, along with creating my own IT support simulations to troubleshoot issues, manage accounts, and solve common tech problems.

Right now, I work as a Sortation Associate at Amazon, where Iâ€™ve developed valuable transferable skillsâ€”like attention to detail, teamwork, and staying calm under pressure. Iâ€™m now applying those strengths to my growing interest in technology, particularly in digital security, user support, and system administration.

Although I donâ€™t come from a traditional tech background, Iâ€™m taking a proactive approach: completing labs, earning certifications, and constantly learning by doing. Iâ€™m excited to contribute to a real-world IT or cybersecurity team where I can grow, support others, and continue learning every day.
