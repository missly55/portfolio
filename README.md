**About Me:**

Hi, Iâ€™m Lynell, an aspiring IT Support and Cybersecurity professional actively building hands-on skills through platforms like TryHackMe and self-guided labs.

By working through real-world scenariosâ€”such as troubleshooting system issues, managing user accounts, and responding to security incidentsâ€”Iâ€™m preparing to bring practical, problem-solving value to an IT team.

Currently, I work as a Sortation Associate at Amazon, where Iâ€™ve developed transferable skills like precision, teamwork, and staying calm under pressure. Now, Iâ€™m channeling those strengths into my passion for technologyâ€”especially in areas like digital security, user support, and system administration.

While Iâ€™m not from a traditional tech background, Iâ€™m bridging that gap through labs, certifications, and continuous learning. Iâ€™m seeking an entry-level IT Support or Cybersecurity role where I can grow and contribute as part of a real-world team.
