##About Me:

Hi, I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional, currently learning and building hands-on skills to break into the field.
    
 I'm especially interested in defensive security and aim to work as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst.

 Iâ€™ve worked on projects using tools like:

OPNsense, Ubuntu, Wireshark, and VirtualBox for network setup and traffic analysis

Nmap and Nessus for vulnerability scanning and network discovery

I'm currently hold certifications like CompTIA Security+, CySA+, and Network+, while sharpening my skills on platforms like TryHackMe.

I'm always learning and looking to grow in areas like network defense, threat detection, and SOC operations.
